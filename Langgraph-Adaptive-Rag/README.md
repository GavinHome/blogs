# Langgraph Adaptive RAG

This directory contains implementation of adaptive retrieval-augmented generation using the Langgraph framework.

## Content

- [langgraph_adaptive_rag.ipynb](langgraph_adaptive_rag.ipynb) - Jupyter notebook implementing adaptive RAG with Langgraph

## Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances language models by retrieving relevant information from external sources before generating responses. This implementation uses Langgraph to create an adaptive RAG system that can dynamically adjust its retrieval and generation strategies based on the input query and context.

The notebook demonstrates:
- How to set up a basic RAG pipeline
- Implementation of adaptive mechanisms for retrieval
- Integration with Langgraph for workflow management
- Evaluation of the adaptive RAG system performance

## Application Implementation
